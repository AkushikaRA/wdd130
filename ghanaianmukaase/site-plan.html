      <h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND (HOME)</h3>
      <p>
        Ghanaian dishes have gained fame and popularity over the years as a result of globalization and the internet.
         Kitchen in the Ghanaian language Twi is Mukaase, hence the reason for the name of this website the Ghanaian Mukaase which means the Ghanaian kitchen. 
         This website will look at different foods from the four regions in Ghana. The website will be categorized into 3 sections. 
         The first section is the cultural background of each food, how to prepare the food and the section where people can share their recipes and different ways they cook their Ghanaian dishes. 
         This will help my audience understand the various beliefs that surround that particular food. 
         Ghana is a multicultural country and hence food is cooked differently depending on the region. People in the Northern part of the country mainly have food that is dry or food that mainly has dry ingredients because of the heat in the North. Foods like “Tuo-Zaafi” and “Tuubani” is eaten by people in the North.
          Whilst people in the south eat foods like “Banku and “Fufu”. This part of the website will look at the cultural background but in four parts.
           The North, South, East and Western part of Ghana. It will explain why the people eat these foods due to the weather, the culture and beliefs of the particular regions. 
         This will answer the questions the visitors have on why we eat these foods.

      </ul>
      <h3>FOOD RECIPES</h3>
      <p>
        In this part the recipes of the various foods will be given. This will answer the questions the visitors have on how to cook these various foods.
         This will give a step by step recipe on how to cook the food with pictures on how the food will look in each step. 
        My visitors will come to my website instead of going to other websites because I will give them a cultural background instead of going straight to the recipe.

      </ul>
      <h3>SHARE YOUR RECIPE</h3>
      <p>
        The joy about cooking is that we do not have a straight way to cook certain foods and that seemingly applies to some Ghanaian foods. 
        People have different ways of cooking the same food and so my website will give people the opportunity to share ways they cook their food differently too.
         This will help improve interactivity on the website. 
        Also, it will give other viewers the opportunity to view other recipes that they fell will be easier to cook compared to the original recipe on the website.
