      <h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND (HOME)</h3>
      <p>
        Ghanaian dishes have gained fame and popularity over the years as a result of globalization and the internet.
         Kitchen in the Ghanaian language Twi is Mukaase, hence the reason for the name of this website the Ghanaian Mukaase which means the Ghanaian kitchen. 
         This website will look at different foods from the four regions in Ghana. The website will be categorized into 3 sections. 
         The first section is the cultural background of each food, how to prepare the food and the section where you can share recipes and different ways you cook your Ghanaian dishes.
         Ghana is a multicultural country and hence food is cooked differently depending on the region. People in the Northern part of the country mainly have food that is dry or food that mainly has dry ingredients 
         because of the heat in the North. Foods like “Tuo-Zaafi” and “Tuubani” is eaten by people in the North.
          Whilst people in the south eat foods like “Banku and “Fufu”. Tuo Zaafi also known as Di3huo is a popular staple in Ghana. It is most common in the three northern regions.
          The dish consists of cooked Maize dough with a little dried cassava dough and water without salt. Traditionally, it is prepared with millet or corn dough
          The dish is usually eaten for dinner, yet some people like to have it for breakfast or lunch.
          On the other hand Fufu is a starchy dough that takes on different forms (and names) across many West African countries. However the name ‘Fufu’ is most commonly associated with Ghana, specifically with the Akan ethnic group.
          Ghanaian Fufu is commonly made by “pounding” cassava and unripe plantains together into a paste, which is then molded by hand into a ball shape and served with a special sauce/soup. In essence it is the sauce/soup that 
          really gives each Fufu dish its unique identity. In Ghana, the common Fufu dishes are Fufu with Light Soup, Fufu with Palm Nut Soup and Fufu with Groundnut Soup.

        TUO ZAAFI RECIPE
      </p>
      <p>  
        A bunch of fresh ayoyo leaves. The alternative is a frozen pack of ayoyo leaves (also known as jute or ewedu leaves)
        1 cup Cassava flour 1 cup Corn flour
        Herrings or other smoked fish Salt to taste
        How to Make it:
        Make the ayoyo sauce
        1. Thoroughly wash the ayoyo leaves and cut into tiny pieces (if using fresh leaves), or if using frozen ones, allow to defrost or defrost in a microwave.
        2. Put 1 cup of water in pot, place on stove, and turn heat to high until water boils. Then lower the heat to medium.
        3. Add the ayoyo to the boiling water and stir periodically with a wooden pestle until the leaves break up in the water, and it starts to froth and bubble. As desired, you can add smoked or dried herrings and salt to the ayoyo for additional flavor.
        4. Lower the heat to low, and continue to stir for another 10 minutes. Then turn down the heat, and set aside the ayoyo mix till you're ready to serve.
       
        NextStep Make the tuo zaafi
        1. Boil 2 cups of water in a pot, until it is boiling.
        2. Scoop 1 cup of corn flour and mix with cold water. Stir thoroughly until the mixture is consistent. Add the mixture to the boiling water and stir with a wooden pestle, taking care to avoid any lumps. Once fully mixed, leave it to boil for 8 to 10 minutes. Then scoop out about a third of the mixture to use later.
        3. Add the remainder of the corn flour to the boilding porridge mixture, and stir with the wooden pestle as the mixture gradually solidiWes. Add the flour bit by bit, and continue to stir. As needed, add the set-aside mixture to the pot to keep the mixture moist at all times. The goal is to avoid lumps. Practice makes perfect here, so if you are not successful at avoiding lumps the worst time, don’t feel bad too much.
        4. After stirring for 20-30 minutes, the tuo should be ready. Scoop a bit and mold into somewhat round shapes, or directly into the serving dishes.
       
        Serve and Enjoy!
        Serve the tuo zaafi as follows: scoop the tuo in a serving dish or better yet a bowl. Then add a generous amount of ayoyo on top of the tuo. Lastly, add the goat meat stew on top. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
