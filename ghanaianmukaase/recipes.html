        <p>
        INGREDIENTS: A bunch of fresh ayoyo leaves. The alternative is a frozen pack of ayoyo leaves (also known as jute or ewedu leaves)
         1 cup Cassava flour, 1 cup Corn flour,
        Herrings or other smoked fish, Salt to taste
        </p>
        <P>
        HOW TO MAKE IT:
        Make the ayoyo sauce
         Thoroughly wash the ayoyo leaves and cut into tiny pieces (if using fresh leaves), or if using frozen ones, allow to defrost or defrost in a microwave.
         Put 1 cup of water in pot, place on stove, and turn heat to high until water boils. Then lower the heat to medium.
         Add the ayoyo to the boiling water and stir periodically with a wooden pestle until the leaves break up in the water, and it starts to froth and bubble. As desired, you can add smoked or dried herrings and salt to the ayoyo for additional flavor.
         Lower the heat to low, and continue to stir for another 10 minutes. Then turn down the heat, and set aside the ayoyo mix till you're ready to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
        NEXT STEP: Make the tuo zaafi
         Boil 2 cups of water in a pot, until it is boiling.
         Scoop 1 cup of corn flour and mix with cold water. Stir thoroughly until the mixture is consistent. Add the mixture to the boiling water and stir with a wooden pestle, taking care to avoid any lumps. Once fully mixed, leave it to boil for 8 to 10 minutes. Then scoop out about a third of the mixture to use later.
         Add the remainder of the corn flour to the boilding porridge mixture, and stir with the wooden pestle as the mixture gradually solidiWes. Add the flour bit by bit, and continue to stir. As needed, add the set-aside mixture to the pot to keep the mixture moist at all times. The goal is to avoid lumps. Practice makes perfect here, so if you are not successful at avoiding lumps the worst time, donâ€™t feel bad too much.
         After stirring for 20-30 minutes, the tuo should be ready. Scoop a bit and mold into somewhat round shapes, or directly into the serving dishes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Serve and Enjoy!
        Serve the tuo zaafi as follows: scoop the tuo in a serving dish or better yet a bowl. Then add a generous amount of ayoyo on top of the tuo. Lastly, add the goat meat stew on top. Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
