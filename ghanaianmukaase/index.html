            <h4>Learn More about Ghana's History </h4>
            <p>
                The Empire of Ghana formed in 300AD when different tribes of the Soninke people were united under the first king, Dinga Cisse. 
                The Soninke people used the word ‘Ghana’, meaning ‘Warrior King’ to refer to the king, and the Empire’s enemies and allies subsequently began to refer to the region as ‘Ghana’. 
                The Empire was actually located northwest of present-day Ghana, in what is now Mauritania, Senegal and Mali, but was gradually driven towards the coast by attacks from tribal groups 
                in northern Africa who wanted the Empire to convert to Islam.
                In 1957, the Gold Coast became the first sub-Saharan colony to become an independent nation under President Kwame Nkrumah, who had led the fight for independence. 
                Nkrumah was a Pan-African nationalist who saw Ghana’s independence as crucial for the entire continent of Africa. As the Gold Coast officially gained independence, 
                Nkrumah declared, “Our independence is meaningless until it is linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.” Encouraged by Ghana’s example, more than 30 
                African countries followed suit and declared independence over the next decade.

              Following independence, the country was renamed Ghana, as it was believed that many of the new nation’s inhabitants were descended from the Soninke people who lived in the ancient Empire of Ghana.
              Ghana’s flag incorporates the Pan-African colours of red, yellow, green and black to represent political unity between all those who live in Africa, and features the black star as a symbol of Ghana’s new freedom.
              The currency was also changed from the British West African Pound to Ghanaian Cedis. Fun fact: The word cedi is the Akan word for cowry shell, and these shells were used as currency until 1901. Cowry shells aren’t native to Ghana’s waters 
              but were introduced as a form of currency in West Africa by traders from Arabia in the 1300s!
